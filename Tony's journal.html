        My Trip Around the USA on a Segway
        <br> Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!
        <br>
        <h2>August 20, 2012<br></h2>
        <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
            <ol>
                <li>Walla Walla, </li>
                <li> WA, Magic City, ID, </li>
                <li>Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, </li>
                <li> Truth or Consequences, NM,</li>
                <li>Why, AZ </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
            <br> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road t oday:
            <blockquote>
                "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
            </blockquote>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars.

            <br>
            <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
            <br> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>cellphone
                    <li>iPod digital camera
                        <li>protein bar</li>
                        <br> As Lao Tzu would have said,
                        <blockquote>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</blockquote>
